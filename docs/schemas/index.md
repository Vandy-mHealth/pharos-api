There are two types of schema involved in Pharos API

- **request/schema**: controls the required input/output when submitting `GET` , `POST`, `PUT` requests

- **database schema**: controls the data is actually stored inside the database

For example, a user entity has the following schema

field | `POST` Request | database |
:-:| :-: | :-:|
id     |  | **auto UUID (PK)**
email | **email-like string** | **string**
pin | **big integer** (6 digits) | **big integer**
full_name | **string** | **string**
created_at |  | **datetime**
organization | string | string
address | string | string

`field` indicates both the request json key and database column name.

The second column is the `request/response` schema. A bold field means it is required during creation. A empty field means it won't be used and should be auto-generated by the database.

The third column is the `database` schema. A bold field means it's not nullable in the database.

In summary, the required request to create a user looks like


```js
axios.post(url, {
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "pin": 123456,
  "full_name": "jane doe"
})
```

and the returned response (from the database) will be


```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "pin": 123456,
  "full_name": "jane doe",
  "id": "c301644d-7a4f-4294-adcf-6646d2735202",
  "created_at": "2022-01-24T12:35:47.554672",
  "organization": null,
  "address": null,
  "landmarks": [],
  "photos": [],
  "network_measurements": []
}
```
